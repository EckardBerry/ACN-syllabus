## Human-Centered Design

The framework we use in this course for problem solving and product design is called Human-Centered Design (HCD). HCD is a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs. It’s all about building deep empathy with users, generating tons of ideas, building some working prototypes and sharing them with the users. Eventually you put your new innovative new solution out into the world and try to scale it up.

The first stage of Human-Centered Design starts with gaining a deep understanding of people’s needs. This is sometimes called the Inspiration Phase or the Empathise Stage.
